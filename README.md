[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/konovod/test-crystal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/konovod/test-crystal)


This is a remake of my discontinued project http://sf.net/p/medico in a Crystal language.
 * Game mechanics from a mentioned prototype - done.
 * Improved performance - done, 11kticks/sec even on an Core2Duo tablet
 * Reduced flexibility and autogenerated code instead of lame data-driven approach - done.
 * Specs (more like unittests) covering mechanics and balance - done

 * UI based on BearLibTerminal pseudoconsole library - in progress
 * Improved mechanics and actually some game - planned
