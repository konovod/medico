[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/konovod/test-crystal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/konovod/test-crystal)

Still not much to see here.
This is a remake of my discontinued project http://sf.net/p/medico in a Crystal language.
It is on a stage of (re)implementing basic game mechanics - diseases and substances works, skills and "social" part aren't. There is no UI, only "spec" (unittests), .
